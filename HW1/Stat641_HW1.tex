\textbf{Problem 1} Assuming that all variables other than \emph{z} are normally distributed.\\
A significance level of $\alpha=0.05$ was assumed to test all the hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
The hypothesis for the two-sample t-test for differences in variable \emph{w} between treatment groups will be
\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_0 &:& \mu_{w_0} =\mu_{w_1}\\
  H_1 &:& \mu_{w_0} \neq \mu_{w_1},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mu_{w_0}$ and $\mu_{w_1}$ represent the mean of the variable \emph{w} for each treatment group (\emph{z} = 0, 1, respectively).\\
Assuming equal variances:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
t-statistic & df & p-value\\
\hline
0.0189 & 98 & 0.985\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Two sample t-test for \emph{w}}
\end{table}
There is no statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that there is no significant difference 
in the means of the baseline variable \emph{w} for the two treatment groups.  

\item[(b)]
For response variable \emph{x}:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
Treatment Group & Mean & Std. Dev.\\
\hline
 0 &13.944&  1.091\\
 1 &14.336 & 0.986\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean and Std. Dev. for each treatment group}
\end{table}

Both standard deviations are close to one and the means of the response variable \emph{x} are similar but we would have to test it 
to make any statistical conclusion.

\item[(c)]
The hypothesis for the two-sample t-test for differences in variable \emph{x} between treatment 
groups will be
\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_0 &:& \mu_{x_0} =\mu_{x_1}\\
  H_1 &:& \mu_{x_0} \neq \mu_{x_1},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mu_{x_0}$ and $\mu_{x_1}$ represent the mean of the variable \emph{x} for each treatment group (\emph{z}=0,1, respectively).\\
Assuming equal variances:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
t-statistic & df & p-value\\
\hline
 -1.885 & 98 & 0.0624\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Two sample t-test for \emph{x}}
\end{table}

There is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the means between the two groups are equal.

\item[(e)]
The result of the fitted model is:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & p-value \\ 
  \hline
Intercept & 11.7317 & 0.2223 & 52.78 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
  $\mathbf{z=1}$ & 0.3949 & 0.1388 & 2.85 & \textbf{0.0054} \\ 
  w & 0.7345 & 0.0662 & 11.09 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of \texttt{x$\sim$z+w} }
\end{table}

Adjusting by the baseline value \emph{w}, there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0:\mu_{x_0} =\mu_{x_1}$)
 and we conclude that the means for the response variable \emph{x} between both treatments are not equal (given \emph{w}).

\item[(f)] 
The answers differ since in part (c) we are not controlling by the baseline variable. Once we do, we observe 
significant difference in the response $x$, between two treatments .\\
There is a statistically significant association between \emph{x} and \emph{z}, in spite of adjusting for $w$. In addition, this study was randomized after observing $w$. 
So \emph{w} is {\underline{not}} a confounder variable. 

\item[(g)]
The hypothesis for the two-sample t-test for differences in variable \emph{w} between treatment 
groups will be
\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_0 &:& \mu_{y_0} =\mu_{y_1}\\
  H_1 &:& \mu_{y_0} \neq \mu_{y_1},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mu_{y_0}$ and $\mu_{y_1}$ represent the mean of the variable \emph{y} for each treatment group (\emph{z} = 0, 1, respectively).\\
Assuming equal variances:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
t-statistic & df & p-value\\
\hline
-1.6885 & 98 & 0.09449\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Two sample t-test for \emph{y}}
\end{table}

Based on the p-value we conclude that there is no sifnicant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 

\item[(h)]
To perform a two sample t-test for the response variable \emph{y} between treatment groups, adjusting for the baseline variabe 
\emph{w} is necessary to fit the following linear model:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & p-value \\ 
  \hline
Intercept & 33.6902 & 2.5730 & 13.09 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
   $\mathbf{z=1}$ & 3.3416 & 1.6066 & 2.08 & \textbf{0.0402} \\ 
  w & 5.4083 & 0.7665 & 7.06 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of \texttt{y$\sim$z+w} }
\end{table}

We can see that the conclusion changes adjusting for the baseline. In this case, there is significant evidence to 
reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the means for the response variable \emph{y} between both treatments are not equal, 
after adjusting for \emph{w}.

\item[(i)]
The result of the fitted model is:
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & p-value \\ 
  \hline
Intercept & -63.6200 & 9.8354 & -6.47 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
 $\mathbf{z=1}$ & 0.0658 & 1.1726 & 0.06 & \textbf{0.9554} \\ 
  w & -0.6841 & 0.8095 & -0.85 & 0.4002 \\ 
  x & 8.2946 & 0.8241 & 10.06 & $\sim 0$ \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of \texttt{y $\sim$ z + w + x} }
\end{table}

Adjusting by both \emph{w} and \emph{x}, there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0:\mu_{y_0} =\mu_{y_1}$). 

\item[(j)]
The results from the three previous questions can be summarized as:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{clcc}
\hline
 & Model & p-value for \emph{z} & Diff. bewtween \emph{y} and \emph{z}\\
\hline
(g) & \texttt{y$\sim$z} & 0.0945 & NO\\
(h) & \texttt{y$\sim$z+w} & 0.0402 & YES\\
(i) & \texttt{y$\sim$z+w+x} & 0.9554 & NO\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Results for (g), (h) and (i)}
\end{table}

As in (f), the t-statistic is larger in (h) than in (g) because $w$ accounts for some of the variability of treatment on 
$y$; the point estimates are quite similar, but the standard error in (h) is smaller than in (g).

Both $x$ and $y$ differ by treatment (based on analysis adjusted for $w$, and because of the randomization, this
must be causal. Clearly $x$ and $y$ are associated, but it is unclear in which direction the causality should be.

Although adjustment for $x$ weakens the association between $z$ and $y$, it is still {\underline{not}} a confounder, because $x$ is
observed after the treatment start and the study was randomized. 
\end{enumerate}
